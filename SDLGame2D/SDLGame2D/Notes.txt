SPRITE TYPES
------------
00	SPRITETYPE_DEFAULT			Set by cSprite base class constructor
01	SPRITETYPE_PLAYER			Sprite is Player-Sprite -> cPlayer
02  SPRITETYPE_ENEMY			Sprite is Enemy-Sprite -> cEnemy
03	SPRITETYPE_BLOCK			Sprite is Block-Sprite -> cBock


TODOs:
------
# Collision detection good, but we have player-sprite position jitter when standing on blocks or running in them.
# Animation: Preperation are done quick and dirty in cSprite->drawSprite(...) by defining a hard-coded tempRect2
             used for clipping and only show the first 32x32 pixels of the larger texture player_anim.png.
             Idea: Define a frame counter range that can be set depending on movement direction (right, left, jump etc.)
                   This frame counter needs to set the clip rect for each rendered frame then. Check VSYNC topic,
                   the frame rate dropped dramatically when running on a laptop without charger attached.
# Animation: Introduced a frame counter in main.cpp (to be used for animation frame control
             No animation: Set cSprite::mAnimationFrames to 0 to disable frame handling for this sprite.
             Animation:
                Set cSprite::mAnimationFrame to the number of frames used in the animation (0-based)
                Use a tile-map as texture, define each animation source rectangle as SDL_Rect (x,y,w,h) and add it to the
                mAnimRectList via the public method cSprite::mAddAnimRect(SDL_Rect rect, int postion)


and a lot of changes in cSprite.cpp (AnimFrameCount, AnimRectList)
             that contain clip rectangles and handle animation in the end. Current state: Only one rect 0,0,32,32 which
             actually renders only the first animation frame of the player sprite. But now, blocks are not shown. Why?
             Check on diffs in sprite and player items. This was neglected by now :-(
